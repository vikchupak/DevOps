# When requests fails, possible reasons of the problem

- No Internet Connection
- DNS settings
- Routing table issues
- Firewall settings (Blocking Requests)
- VPN or Proxy settings
- Server-Side Issues or IP Whitelisting

## **1. No Internet Connection**
- **Symptoms**: No response from any website or IP.
- **Causes**:
  - Disconnected from Wi-Fi/Ethernet.
  - Router/modem is down.
  - ISP issues.
  - Network adapter is disabled.

**ðŸ›  Fixes:**
- Check network status: `nmcli device status`
- Restart networking:  
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
  ```
- Try another network.

---

## **2. DNS Resolution Failure**
- **Symptoms**: Error like `Could not resolve host`
- **Causes**:
  - No DNS server configured.
  - DNS server is down.
  - Corrupt `/etc/resolv.conf`.

**ðŸ›  Fixes:**
- Test resolving the domain manually with current DNS
  ```bash
  nslookup <some.domain.com>
  # If it fails, your DNS server may not be working
  ```
- Test resolving the domain manually with another DNS (Google dns)
    ```bash
  nslookup <some.domain.com> 8.8.8.8
  ```
- Check DNS settings:  
  ```sh
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  ```
- Manually set a DNS:  
  ```sh
  echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
  ```
- Restart DNS resolver:  
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
  ```

---

## **3. Network Routing Issues**
- **Symptoms**: Cannot reach specific hosts but can ping `8.8.8.8`.
- **Causes**:
  - Incorrect gateway.
  - Misconfigured static routes.
  - VPN issues.

**ðŸ›  Fixes:**
- Check routing table:  
  ```sh
  ip route
  ```
- Add missing default gateway:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add default via <GATEWAY_IP>
  ```

---

## **4. Firewall Blocking Requests**
- **Symptoms**: Connection refused, no response.
- **Causes**:
  - Local firewall (`iptables`, `ufw`) blocking requests.
  - Corporate or ISP-level firewall.
  - VPN restrictions.

**ðŸ›  Fixes:**
- Check firewall rules:  
  ```sh
  sudo iptables -L
  ```
- Temporarily disable firewall:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop ufw
  ```

---

## **5. VPN or Proxy Interference**
- **Symptoms**: Some sites work, others donâ€™t.
- **Causes**:
  - VPN assigns wrong DNS (e.g., `/32` vs `/23` subnet mask issue).
  - Proxy misconfiguration.

**ðŸ›  Fixes:**
- Check VPN settings:  
  ```sh
  ip a | grep tun
  ```
- Disable VPN and test:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop openconnect
  ```

---

## **6. Server-Side Issues**
- **Symptoms**: Only one site is unreachable.
- **Causes**:
  - Website is down.
  - Server blocking your IP.

**ðŸ›  Fixes:**
- Try a different website.
- Check if the site is down:  
  ```sh
  curl -Is https://example.com | head -n 1
  ```
