# Is firewalld a replacement of ufw?

Firewalld and UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) are both firewall management tools for Linux, but they serve slightly different purposes and have different design philosophies. Here's a comparison:

### Firewalld:
- **Origin**: Developed primarily for Red Hat-based distributions like Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.
- **Architecture**: Uses the concept of zones and services. Zones define the level of trust for a network, and services define a set of rules for specific applications.
- **Flexibility**: More flexible and powerful, allowing for dynamic changes without restarting the firewall.
- **Management**: Managed via command-line (`firewall-cmd`) or graphical interface (`firewall-config`).
- **Integration**: Well-integrated with modern systems using `systemd`.

### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):
- **Origin**: Developed primarily for Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.
- **Architecture**: Designed to be simple and user-friendly, focusing on ease of use for basic firewall tasks.
- **Flexibility**: Simpler and easier to configure, but less flexible compared to firewalld.
- **Management**: Managed via command-line (`ufw`), and there are third-party graphical interfaces available.
- **Integration**: Uses a simpler rule-based approach, making it accessible for beginners.

### Summary:
- **Use Firewalld if**: You need a more flexible, dynamic, and powerful firewall solution, and you are comfortable with a slightly more complex setup. Itâ€™s particularly well-suited for Red Hat-based systems.
- **Use UFW if**: You need a straightforward, easy-to-use firewall for basic tasks, especially on Debian-based systems. It's great for users who prefer simplicity and ease of configuration.

Neither is a direct replacement for the other, as they cater to different user needs and preferences. The choice between the two depends on your specific requirements and the Linux distribution you are using.

# Can they conflict?
___I had the both runnting simultaneously (checked)___

Yes, running both Firewalld and UFW simultaneously can cause conflicts, as they both aim to manage firewall rules. Here's how these conflicts might manifest and what you can do to avoid them:

### Potential Conflicts:
1. **Rule Conflicts**: Both Firewalld and UFW manage iptables rules. If both are active, they may overwrite each other's rules, leading to unexpected firewall behavior.
2. **Resource Contention**: Both tools might compete to control the same network interfaces and firewall chains, causing inconsistencies in the firewall state.
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Managing two firewall services simultaneously can make the system configuration more complex and harder to debug if issues arise.

### Best Practices:
- **Choose One Tool**: To avoid conflicts, it's best to use either Firewalld or UFW, but not both. This ensures that only one tool is managing the firewall rules.
- **Disable the Other Tool**: If you decide to use one, disable the other to prevent it from interfering.

### How to Disable UFW (if using Firewalld):
```sh
sudo ufw disable
sudo systemctl stop ufw
sudo systemctl disable ufw
```

### How to Disable Firewalld (if using UFW):
```sh
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that only one firewall management tool is active, thereby avoiding any conflicts and ensuring smooth operation of your firewall rules.
